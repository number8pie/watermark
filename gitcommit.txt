#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added form: text to use in watermark, file upload button and submit.
Added courier new font file in root.
Created function watermarkMe() that takes two parameters, the image to watermark and the text to watermark on the image.
Checked if the $_POST variable with the key of submit is set and if so set the image and text variables and pass them to the watermarkMe() function.
